        Allegory is a figurative mode of representation conveying meaning
        other than the literal. Allegory communicates its message by means of symbolic figures, actions or symbolic
        representation. Allegory is generally treated as a figure of rhetoric, but an allegory does not have to be
        expressed in language: it may be addressed to the eye, and is often found in realistic painting. An example of a
        simple visual allegory is the image of the grim reaper. Viewers understand that the image of the grim reaper is
        a symbolic representation of death.
