        A figure painting is a work of art in any of the painting media with the primary subject being the human figure,
        whether clothed or nude. Figure painting may also refer to the activity of creating such a work. The human
        figure has been one of the contrast subjects of art since the first stone age cave paintings, and has been
        reinterpreted in various styles throughout history. Some artists well known for figure painting are Peter
        Paul Rubens, Edgar Degas, and Ã‰douard Manet.
