        Landscape painting is a term that covers the depiction of natural scenery such as mountains, valleys, trees,
        rivers, and forests, and especially art where the main subject is a wide view, with its elements arranged into a
        coherent composition. In other works landscape backgrounds for figures can still form an important part of the
        work. Sky is almost always included in the view, and weather is often an element of the composition. Detailed
        landscapes as a distinct subject are not found in all artistic traditions, and develop when there is already a
        sophisticated tradition of representing other subjects. The two main traditions spring from Western painting and
        Chinese art, going back well over a thousand years in both cases.
