        Portrait paintings are representations of a person, in which the face and its expression is predominant. The
        intent is to display the likeness, personality, and even the mood of the person. The art of the portrait
        flourished in Ancient Greek and especially Roman sculpture, where sitters demanded individualized and realistic
        portraits, even unflattering ones. One of the best-known portraits in the Western world is Leonardo da Vinci's
        painting titled Mona Lisa, which is thought to be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del
        Giocondo
