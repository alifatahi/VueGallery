        A still life is a work of art depicting mostly inanimate subject matter, typically commonplace objectsâ€”which may
        be either natural (food, flowers, plants, rocks, or shells) or man-made (drinking glasses, books, vases,
        jewelry, coins, pipes, and so on). With origins in the Middle Ages and Ancient Greek/Roman art, still life
        paintings give the artist more leeway in the arrangement of design elements within a composition than do
        paintings of other types of subjects such as landscape or portraiture. Still life paintings, particularly before
        1700, often contained religious and allegorical symbolism relating to the objects depicted. Some modern still
        life breaks the two-dimensional barrier and employs three-dimensional mixed media, and uses found objects,
        photography, computer graphics, as well as video and sound.
