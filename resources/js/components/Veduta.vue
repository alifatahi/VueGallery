        Illustration paintings are those used as illustrations in books, magazines, and theater or movie posters and
        comic books. Today, there is a growing interest in collecting and admiring the original artwork. Various museum
        exhibitions, magazines and art galleries have devoted space to the illustrators of the past. In the visual art
        world, illustrators have sometimes been considered less important in comparison with fine artists and graphic
        designers. But as the result of computer game and comic industry growth, illustrations are becoming valued as
        popular and profitable art works that can acquire a wider market than the other two, especially in Korea, Japan,
        Hong Kong and United States.
